                <h2> Facts About Dogs</h2>
                <i>Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans,
                     dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour,
                      and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in
                       15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you feel like you have to do it
                        anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught
                         to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect
                          example of this.</i>
